# school-projects
This is a collection of school projects that I have made during semesters of the bachelor Software Engineering at Fontys Hogeschool Eindhoven.

# **Disclaimer**
These projects are first and foremost research projects. Therefore code or architecture quality wasn't always pursued or thought of. Which means that this repository is not a real world representation. These are strictly proof of concepts/prototypes to achieve certain learning outcomes.

The code in this repository should also not be used in any production environment or system since it could contain outdated code, packages and/or oversights in security. These projects were aimed at research, not producing a production ready prototype.

Therefore the code is 'as is' where no maintenance, help, warranty or guarantees will be provided.

## Explanation
### **Semester 3**
Semester 3 was aimed towards being introduced to the concept of microservices. The project I chose to make was a dashboard that retrieved information from a Mineraft server. This included the health and position of players. But also included rich user experiences with live updates if a player enters or leaves the server.

The stack that was used during Semester 3 is:
- Vue.js
- .NET (C#)
- Java 8
- Heroku

### **Semester 7**
Semester 7 had the goal of introducing you to enterprise software architectures. This included microservices, cloud, asynchronous messaging etc. For this project I have made a social media website where users could place posts, follow users and like said tweets.

The stack that was used during Semester 7 is:
- .NET (C#) (Blazor & Web API)
- RabbitMQ
- Keycloak
- Google Cloud
- Nginx Proxy Manager
